## Project 
This project explored the possibility to generate Anti Microbial Peptides (AMPs) specific to particular bacteria clades or strains using Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). 
All details, including the abstract can be found in the final report. 

Note that this project has been developped as a final project for the class 6.8701 in the Computer Science department of MIT and is undergoing publication so can't be reused for personnal projects so far.
